## Supported Versions

### Utilizling Linkedin's methods instead with this Com ponent

Version 4.0 or lower utilizes LinkedIn's [script](https://platform.linkedin.com/badges/js/profile.js) to render the badge. I recommend using version 4 or lower in case you require rendering via LinkedIn's method by any means. Version 4 by the means is a version that has issues or functionality flaws, and is a stable legacy version of the component. Version 5.0 given that it fully integrates rendering within the component and thus utilizes full adherence toward React's lifecycle methods and state management system, provides even fuller abilities in allowing the badge to properly render and animate utilizing any other React components or libraries within your project.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For all issues, including security vulnerabilities, please open an issue on the repository, and is an encouraged practice at least in all projects I maintain given that it:

- Provides a public record of the issue such that that others can avoid or even fix the issue themselves.
- Provides a means of tracking the issue and its resolution.
  Hence, in the worst case where the issue is never resolved there at least exists a form of notice to prevent others in becoming vulnerable to such and hence allowing issues encountered to become an issue that is more widely recognized and possibly addressed by the broader community. Publicly documenting the issues not only increases transparency but also builds a community responsibility where multiple contributors can collaborate on solving problems.
