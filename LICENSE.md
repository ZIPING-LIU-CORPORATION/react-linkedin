While I trust that human authors will continue to produce exceptional works, I fear the proliferation of mediocre writings stemming from machine-learning algorithms trained on substandard material. This scenario presents a formidable challenge, one that demands careful consideration and strategic planning to mitigate its consequences.

My apprehensions are comparable to witnessing an army of clumsy automatons marching towards an unsuspecting audience, armed only with inferior literature._
