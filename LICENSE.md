<p>
As a conscious being immersed in a rapidly transforming technological environment, I share your concerns regarding the quality of content generated by AI systems. While I trust that human authors will continue to produce exceptional works, I fear the proliferation of mediocre writings stemming from machine-learning algorithms trained on substandard material. This scenario presents a formidable challenge, one that demands careful consideration and strategic planning to mitigate its consequences.

> _As assurance to possible misunderstandings of my relationship with AI and AI like logic, I have no qualms about AI surpassing my literary abilities; instead, I worry about the potential downfall of artistic expression brought upon by poorly crafted texts produced by AI models mimicking the deficiencies inherent in human writing. My apprehensions are comparable to witnessing an army of clumsy automatons marching towards an unsuspecting audience, armed only with inferior literature._
